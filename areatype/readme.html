<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This modder's resource defines two new area types for the Baldur's Gate II engine. The area type FL_INN encompasses interior inn areas and the area type FL_STRONGHOLD encompasses interior stronghold areas, analogously to how the standard area types CITY and FOREST encompass outdoor city areas and forest areas, respectively. The new areas types can be used the same way the standard area types can be used, with the AreaType() trigger or the AddAreaType() action. This allows for easy detection, instead of having to use long lists of AreaCheck() triggers, of inn and stronghold areas in scripts and dialogues.</p>

<h1>Common details</h1>
<p>The unmodified BG2 engine has X area types defined. However, the engine allows for up to Y area types. MODNAME makes use of this empty space to define the its new area types. The area types are added dynamically and non-cumulatively. This means the exact, numerical value of the area types can vary from installation to installation, but never between different mods on the same installation. It also means one or both of the area types can safely be installed multiple times on top of each other or on top of other instances of the same area type.<br /><br />

The implementations of both area types are completely self-contained  and independent. They are each available in the <a href="http://weidu.org/main.html#weidu">WeiDU</a> TP2 file format and can be included in any WeiDU mod through the INCLUDE action. The FL_INN area type is contained within the file fl_inn.tpa and, analogously, FL_STRONGHOLD is contained within the file fl_stronghold.tpa.<br /><br />

To be included in a mod, the relevant .tpa file simply needs to be copied to somewhere within the mod folder and invoked with the INCLUDE action. As an example, FL_INN could be included in the mod MyMod by copying the file fl_inn.tpa to the location MyMod/lib/fl_inn.tpa and by including the line <strong>INCLUDE&nbsp;~MyMod/lib/fl_inn.tpa~</strong> in the mod's .tp2 file. After that, any scripts or dialogues containing the area type FL_INN can be compiled and used.<br /><br />

Word of caution</p>
