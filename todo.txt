look into Maurezhi and possibly replace rr#dmfea with fl#cnefr
test yugoloth together with tanar'ri/baatezu
succubuses do not attack elves or females, apparently
can you have multiple call lightning going concurrently
add EFF-based immunities to spells, maybe
boot to Win to test integrate_sectypes
pick out colours for Arcanaloth on Win
test even more revised fiend summoning, include priest spell
put yugoloth scripts through their combat paces
decide what to do about the Arcanaloth's on-hit effect
