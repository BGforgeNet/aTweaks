        <h4>Introduction </h4>
        <p><big><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></big><br />
          This mod represents a compilation of<acronym title="Pen and Paper"></acronym>
          various house rules and <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>
          related tweaks which are designed to change certain aspects of
          the game. It works on normal Baldur's Gate II games as well as
          either of the two Baldur's Gate conversion projects: (Easy)<acronym title="Baldur's Gate 1 to 2">Tutu</acronym> and Baldur's
          Gate Trilogy (<acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym>).
The

          components "Simple Thief Script" and "Simple Bard Script" can
          also be installed on Icewind Dale and Icewind Dale II. The mod
          is divided into multiple components all of which can be
          installed separately and are completely independent of each
          other.</p>
        <p>In summary, aTweaks can bring several classes, races, spells,
          items and creatures closer to their&nbsp;<acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>
          counterparts, add more consistency to the gameplay by making
          sensible rule adjustments and eliminating exploits, and make
          it easier to distinguish between creatures with similar
          avatars through the use of recoloring techniques. </p>
        <div class="divimp"> <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: In
            order to experience all of the new content introduced by
            this mod it is recommended to <span style="font-weight: bold;">start

        <h4>Compatibility notes </h4>
        <p> This&nbsp;mod should be compatible with most other&nbsp;<a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/README-WeiDU.html" target="_blank"><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym></a>
          mods. In particular, aTweaks has been coded in a special
          manner which prevents unnecessary content duplication in case
          one of its components is already contained within other mods.
          For best results, always install this mod after any other
          mods&nbsp;in order&nbsp;to ensure maximum compatibility.&nbsp;<br />
          <span style="font-style: italic;"></span> </p>
        <div class="divimp"> Note:&nbsp;If you intend to install aTweaks
          alongside other mods please consult the <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/topic/44513-comprehensive-compatibility-guide-and-recommended-install-order/?s=cfefecdf53f2dfad321e88aa0b3dfc30" target="_blank">Compatibility Guide</a> beforehand.
          Furthermore, since aTweaks and Rogue Rebalancing share certain
          resources, it's very important to always install aTweaks last.
          To emphasize the point, never install <span style="font-weight: bold;">any</span>
          component of Rogue Rebalancing after aTweaks. </div>

        <p>This mod is packaged and installed with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.weidu.org/%7Ethebigg/README-WeiDU.html" target="_blank"><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym></a>
          and is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To start the
          installation procedure simply double click on the
          self-extracting archive and point the installer to your
          Baldur's Gate 2 folder (default path C:\Program Files\Black
          Isle\BGII - SoA\). In case you are installing this mod for a&nbsp;<acronym title="Baldur's Gate 1 to 2">BG1Tutu</acronym> or a&nbsp;<acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> game point the
          installer to your&nbsp;<acronym title="Baldur's Gate 1 to 2">BG1Tutu</acronym>/<acronym title="Baldur's Gate Trilogy">BGT</acronym> folder instead.
          Before starting the installation&nbsp;procedure make sure that
          neither Baldur's Gate 2 nor any third party editors such as <a href="http://www.mud-master.com/shadowkeeper/" target="_blank">Shadow

            Keeper</a> and <a href="http://infexp.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Infinity

            Explorer</a> are currently running. After installing the mod
          you can re-run "Setup-aTweaks.exe" in your&nbsp;<acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2">BG2</acronym>
          folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change its
          components. </p>

          innate infravision trait to Half-Orc characters which
          was&nbsp;missing in the unmodded game. In order for this tweak to
          work, you need to turn on the party&nbsp;<acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>
          for 5–10 seconds&nbsp;until the appropriate script block triggers.

            skeletal undead from being affected by Illithids' Devour
            Brain attack</span>This component prevents skeletal undead
          creatures (such as summoned Skeletons and Skeleton Warriors)
          from being affected by the Devour Brain attack of Illithids.
          Since skeletal undead have no internal organs per&nbsp;<acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>
          rules, they should not be affected by this particular attack
          and thus cannot die from having their intelligence score
          drained to zero.<br />
          <br />
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Spiritual_Hammer_force_weapon"></a>Change

            Spiritual Hammer into a ranged force weapon</span><br />
          This component changes the magical hammer created by the level
          2 cleric spell Spiritual Weapon into a ranged force weapon,&nbsp;as
          per&nbsp;<acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> rules. The
          hammer now deals magical damage and can strike from a
          distance. However,&nbsp;it is now affected by the magic resistance
          of the target and no longer adds the strength bonus of its
          wielder to the damage that it deals. Since the hammer is
          supposed to be controlled telepathically (rather than being
          actually held or thrown) the wielder does not receive the
          standard penalty for holding a ranged weapon when engaged in
          close combat.<br />

          <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Dispelable_Globes"></a>Allow

            Dispel/Remove Magic to take down Globes of Invulnerability</span><br />
          This component changes the Minor Globe of Invulnerability and
          the Globe of Invulnerability spells and makes them dispellable
          by Dispel/Remove Magic, as per&nbsp;<acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>
          rules. The original in-game descriptions of those spells
          suggests that this behavior may have been intended by the
          developers.<br />
          <br />
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="PnP_Color_Spray"></a>PnP

            Color Spray</span><br />
          This component brings the Color Spray spell closer to its&nbsp;<acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> counterpart. New
          description:<br />
          Upon the casting of this spell, a vivid, fan-shaped spray of
          clashing colors spring forth in front of the caster. All
          creatures in the area of effect are entitled a saving throw
          vs. spell to avoid the effects, if they are above the 6th
          level or above the level of the caster. Blind or unseeing
          creatures are not affected. Creatures that are not allowed a
          saving throw, or that fail their saving throw, and whose level
          is below or equal to the level of the caster are struck
          unconscious for 4 rounds; those whose level is 1 or 2 greater
          than the level of the caster are struck blind for 2 rounds;
          those that are 3 or more levels above the level of the caster
          are disoriented and unable to think or act coherently for 1
          round.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="PnP_Dimension_Door"></a>PnP Dimension Door</span><br />
          This component brings the Dimension Door spell closer to its&nbsp;<acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>
counterpart. The spell can now be used on any point on the current map
that the party has already explored i.e it is no longer limited to the
caster's visual range. Furthermore, all merchants that carry a
Confusion scroll now also carry a Dimension Door scroll. &nbsp;Lastly,
if TobEx is installed, this component will restore the Dimension Door
spell to the mage/sorcerer spell selection screen.<br />ATTENTION: be
careful when using this spell. With the restored functionality it's
possible to accidentally teleport over a plot critical ground trigger
which could potentially prevent certain scripted events from occurring.<br />
          <br />
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Magical_Projectiles"></a>Magical

            arrows and bolts deal bonus damage equal to their
            enchantment level</span><br />This component allows magical bolts
          and arrows to deal bonus damage appropriate to their
          enchantment level,&nbsp;as per&nbsp;<acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>
          rules. For example, this means that an Arrow +1 now deals
          1d6+1 damage while an Arrow +2 deals 1d6+2 damage... etc. For
          reference, both&nbsp;&nbsp;<acronym title="Baldur's Gate 1">BG1</acronym>
          and&nbsp;<acronym title="Icewind Dale 1">IWD1</acronym> had
          correctly implemented this feature, but for some reason, the
          designers of&nbsp;<acronym title="Baldur's Gate 2">BG2</acronym>
          chose to omit the enchantment bonus&nbsp;to damage for arrows and
          bolts. Note that this tweak only applies to generic (+x)
          enchanted arrows, bolts and&nbsp;magical quivers. Special, yet
          non-enchanted, ammo varieties such as Arrows of Piercing and

          This component grants all Mages (except Sorcerers) of 9<sup>th</sup>
          level and higher the ability to scribe spells from their
          spellbooks onto scrolls, as per&nbsp;<acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>
          rules. Only&nbsp;spells that are currently memorized may be scribed
          in this manner. Furthermore, the cost of any raw materials
          that are used in the process must be covered in full. Finally,
          inscribing a scroll&nbsp;removes one instance of the spell in
          question from the caster's memory. This ability can be used at
          will, as long as the environment is non-hostile.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />

            <a name="Paladins_and_disease"></a>Restore innate disease

          This component makes all Paladins inherently immune
          to&nbsp;disease, as per&nbsp;<acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>
          rules. It also adds an innate Cure Disease ability, usable
          once per day, to the True Paladin and Cavalier kits. The
          Inquisitor and Undead Hunter kits&nbsp;do not receive the Cure
          Disease ability due to their respective restrictions. Note: a
          new game must be started in order for this component to
          function properly.<br />

Animal

            Empathy improves with experience</span><br />
          This component renames the Ranger's Charm Animal ability
          into&nbsp;Animal Empathy and adjusts it to more closely match its <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> counterpart. An&nbsp;animal
          attempting to resist this ability must now roll a saving throw
          vs. wands (with a −1 penalty) in order to avoid becoming
          charmed. The Ranger imposes an additional saving throw penalty
          for every three experience levels he has earned (i.e. −2 at 4<sup>th</sup>
          level, −3 at 7<sup>th</sup> level... etc.) up to a maximum of
          −6 at 16<sup>th</sup> level. Furthermore, if the animal fails
          its saving throw, it now becomes charmed for 5 rounds per
          level of the Ranger. Finally, being non-magical in nature,
          this ability now ignores any magic resistance of the target
          animal and can no longer be removed by Dispel Magic. <br />

          This component brings all Fiends in the game closer to their <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> counterparts.
          Legitimately missing abilities are restored and spuriously
          granted benefits are removed. The Fiends' <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>
          has been enhanced as well, and it now allows them to act in
          accordance to their <acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym>
          behavior and intelligence scores. In effect, these changes
          moderately increase the difficulty of dealing with Fiend
          opponents. Finally, the Blood War now plays a slightly more
          prominent role. Whenever Baatezu and Tanar'ri meet, they will
          taunt and fight each other. This will take precedence over any
          other actions unless the Fiends' existence is endangered by a
          more powerful enemy.<br />
          <br />
          This component is available as three subcomponents.<br />
          The first subcomponent installs PnP Fiends without making
          changes to mod-added fiends. This&nbsp;means that
          mod-added fiends can have different statistics and abilities
          than normal fiends.<br />
          The second subcomponent installs PnP Fiends while aiming to
          affect mod-added fiends as well (currently this only extends
          to affecting fiends from SCSII). This means you won't
          necessarily encounter fiends that have different statistics
          and behave differently, merely because they belong to another
          mod. Some unique or otherwise special fiends can have better
          statistics than the corresponding regular fiend. Also, not
          every mod-added fiend is affected.<br />
          The third subcomponent installs PnP Fiends without making any
          notable changes to the statistics of the fiends. I.e. it only
          installs aTweaks' fiend scripts (governing behaviour and
          abilities). Mod-added fiends are affected to the same extent
          as in the second subcomponent.<br />
          <br />
          In addition to altering the statistics and abilities of
          fiends, this component also affects several aspects of the
          fiend-summoning process. Firstly, while summoned Fiends still
          remain uncontrollable, they now match the allegiance of their
          summoner. This allows the summoner to receive experience
          points for each opponent that the Fiends defeats, but it also
          applies the appropriate reputation penalty for each innocent
          that the Fiend murders. Secondly, the nature of a summoned
          Fiend now corresponds to the alignment of its summoner. A
          Baatezu appears if the caster is lawfully aligned, while a
          Tanar'ri appears if the caster is chaotically aligned.&nbsp;If the
          caster is neither lawfully nor chaotically aligned, a Yugoloth
          will be summoned instead. Lastly, the party now gains XP for
          killing Fiends summoned by opponents. <a href="http://readme.spellholdstudios.net/rr_fiends.html#PnP_Fiends" target="_blank">More information</a> is available online.<br />

          This component is an optional add-on to 'PnP Fiends' and, as
          such, it requires that 'PnP Fiends' be installed first.<br />
          The component alters the Fiend-summoning spells to, instead of
          summoning a specific type of fiend, give you a choice as to
          what type of find to summon. Chaotically aligned casters may
          choose between summoning a Tanar'ri and a Yugoloth and
          lawfully aligned casters may choose between summoning a
          Baatezu and a Yugoloth. Casters who are neither chaotically
          nor lawfully aligned may choose between any of the three types
          of fiends. The choice is made when the spell is cast by having
          the player choose from a sub-menu of spells (analogously to
          how the spells Enchanted Weapon or Spell Immunity or work).<br />

          <b><a name="fiendish_gating">Fiendish gating</a></b><br />
            This component is an optional add-on to 'PnP Fiends' and, as
            such, it requires that 'PnP Fiends' be installed first.<br />
            The component gives fiends the ability to gate in other
            fiends, as outlined in PnP sources. A fiend may only attempt
            to open a gate every so often and the attempt may not
            necessarily be successful. Only fiends which were not
            themselves gated may open gates. Fiendish gating can be
            disabled at any time with the following console command:<br />
            CLUAConsole:SetGlobal("RR#FNOGT","GLOBAL",1) It can also be
            re-enabled with the following command:<br />
            CLUAConsole:SetGlobal("RR#FNOGT","GLOBAL",0)&nbsp; The

          nature of the Infinity Engine, this Stoneskin effect could not

          due to his divine heritage. It can be installed in two ways.
          The first option converts the Bhaalpowers into slightly more

          merely reduces their casting time&nbsp;to 1 which is consistent
          with other spell-like abilities as well as the casting time of

          start BG2 with one use of Vampiric Touch you will gain 2 uses
          of Draw Upon Holy Might in ToB. If you start BG2 with 2 uses
          of Vampiric Touch you will gain 2 uses of Draw Upon Holy Might
          in ToB if your alignment is good, 2 uses of Vampiric Touch if
          your alignment is evil and 1 use of each if your alignment is
          neutral.<br />

          get the dreaded "Spell Disrupted" message while attempting to
          shapeshift as a Druid. Furthermore, this tweak will also

          </span>This component prevents illusionary clones created by
          the Mislead spell from singing Bard songs. When ordered to
          sing, an illusionary clone will now only mimic the mouth
          movements of the original caster without making any sound and
          thus won't provide any battlesong benefits to nearby allies,
          nor hinder adjacent enemies in case the original caster was a

          the Project Image and Simulacrum spells from using expendable

          this tweak closes the exploit which previously allowed the

          such as Protection from Magic scrolls.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><a name="Dispellable_Nishruu"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Restore the Dispel Magic
            vulnerability to Nishruu and Hakeashars<br />
          </span>The Nishruu and Hakeashar&nbsp;<acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>
          scripts indicate that the developers originally indented for
          Dispel/Remove Magic to instantly kill these creatures.
          Unfortunately, due to a targeting bug, the script block
          responsible for this behavior could never properly execute for
          player characters (though it always worked fine for
          opponents). This component fixes that oversight and makes
          Nishruu and Hakeashars vulnerable to Dispel/Remove Magic cast
          by player characters. If the caster successfully makes a
          Dispel/Remove Magic check against these creatures, they will
          be instantly slain. Furthermore,&nbsp;Nishruu and Hakeashars are
          now also vulnerable to items which dispel magical effects on
          hit (i.e. Arrows of Dispelling, Staff of the Magi and
          Carsomyr).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Make_Death_Ward_protect_against_Vorpal"></a>Make Death Ward protect against Vorpal Hits<br />

          and&nbsp;Detect Evil spells. In addition to displaying the
          alignment of the target on the Good–Evil scale, these spells
          now also display the target's alignment on the Law–Chaos
          scale. For example, casting Know Alignment on Keldorn will now
          display "Lawful Good" instead of merely "Good". Similarly,
          casting Detect Evil near Korgan will now list his alignment as
          "Chaotic Evil" instead of merely "Evil".<br />

          game, the racial saving throw bonus was capped at +5. With the

          enemies) or to the battlesongs of all Bards. Both options will

          there are no enemies in his line of sight. Note that the Thief

          there are no enemies nearby and stop once combat starts.
          Pressing the 'D' key toggles this setting and allows the Bard
          to sing constantly, regardless of enemy presence, or only sing

          either The Ballad of the Three Heroes, The War Chant of Sith
          or The Tale of Curran Strongheart, provided the Bard knows
          these songs. </div>

component assigns a unique soundset to Shambling Mounds rather than
having them mimic the Earth Elemental soundset. It also&nbsp;assigns a
new soundset&nbsp;to all Mariliths in the game which is based
on&nbsp;Yxunomei, the Marilith from Icewind Dale. Finally, it
assigns&nbsp;the proper soundsets to all
Dryads,&nbsp;Nymphs,&nbsp;Sirines and Succubi. </div>

              tweaks</span></small></h3>
        <div class="divimp">This group of tweaks consists of
          miscellaneous changes which don't directly fit into any of the
          previously mentioned categories.<br />
          <br />
          <a name="Expanded_containers"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">
          </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Slightly expanded
            storage capacity for containers<br />
          </span>This component slightly expands the storage capacity of
          all containers in the game (Gem Bags, Scroll Cases, Bags of
          Holding... etc.). It can be installed in two ways, by either
          using the recommended setting of 999 items per container or by
          entering a custom value for the storage capacity. The
          difference between this tweak and similar components from
          other mods is that containers with the recommended storage
          capacity of 999 (or below) shouldn't slow down the engine as
          much as the truly bottomless containers. Note that this tweak
          won't lower the capacity of containers which can already carry
          more&nbsp;than 999 items (such as Ammo Belts).<br />
          <br />
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Expanded_temple_services_"></a>Expanded

            temple services<br />
          </span>This component slightly expands the&nbsp;selection of
          curative spells which can be cast by&nbsp;<acronym title="Non Player Character">NPC</acronym>
          priests in temples. The spell selection is expanded as
          follows:<br />
          <ul>
            <li>Any priest who currently has the Dispel Magic spell
              under his service tab gains the Cure Disease spell</li>
            <li>Any priest who currently has the Cure Moderate Wounds
              spell under his service tab gains the Neutralize Poison
              and Lesser Restoration spells </li>
            <li>Any priest who currently has the Cure Critical Wounds
              spell under his service tab gains the Mass Cure spell </li>
          </ul>
          In summary, this tweak should make it a bit easier for solo
          players and parties without access to divine magic to get
          cured of disease, blindness, deafness, feeblemind and level
          drain.<br />

Coloring was installed without PnP Fiends</li><li>Slightly increased the priority of opening gates for certain fiends</li><li>Fixed
an original game bug which caused a script loop in AR1500 (Spellhold

Sirines from spawning properly</li><li>Fixed some minor issues with PnP Color Spray</li><li>Most of aTweaks' components can now be installed on SoA-only games</li><li>aTweaks now uses ENGINE_IS to determine the type of your installation (i.e. BG2-SoA, ToB, BGT... etc.)</li></ul><b>v3.71 – November 11, 2011</b><br />

          <ul><li>Added
the "PnP Fey creatures", "Revised Call Woodland Beings spell", "PnP
Dimension Door" and "Make Death Ward protect against Vorpal Hits"
components</li><li>The components "Give Shambling Mounds their proper soundset" and "Give Mariliths their Icewind Dale soundset"&nbsp; have been

soundsets" components</li><li>Hellcats are now properly immune to all mind-affecting spells and grant 5,000 XP when killed</li><li>The movement rate of several fiends was erroneously set too slow. Their speed now&nbsp;matches the given PnP rating</li><li>Due to a typo, several mephits and fiends that are immune to fire were also&nbsp;erroneously made immune to Cloudkill</li><li>Fiends of the same type will now coordinate their attacks better. When
one fiend encounters an enemy, it will try to telepathically alert any nearby fiends
of its type to the enemy's presence. The alerted fiends will then attempt to teleport to its location</li><li>Oozes, constructs, elementals, skeletal undead and
incorporeal creatures are now immune to the Balors' vorpal hits</li><li>The
intense flames which engulf a Balor's body will now burn through webs

Balors can now finish off&nbsp;Trolls that have been knocked down by
approaching them and triggering the Body Flames ability</li><li>The

no longer be attacked before the gating animation is complete</li><li>Restored the Pyrotechnics spell-like ability to Balors, Mariliths, Abishai, Cornugons and&nbsp;Pit Fiends<br /></li></ul><b>v3.67 – October 2, 2011</b><br /><ul><li>Replaced G triggers in "Regain Bhaalpowers in ToB" to avoid possible unreliability.</li><li>Resolved
a cosmetic incompatibility between the fiend components of SCSII and
aTweaks (provided aTweaks is installed second) which produced a
green-tinted Glabrezu and Marilith inside the Planar Sphere.</li><li>Ultroloths now correctly make two attacks per round.</li><li>Yugoloth
are now created in a more robust manner (they are no longer copied from
other fiend files). Notably this means they no longer have the Balor
off-hand weapon.</li><li>Updated to WeiDU 230.</li></ul><b>v3.66 – September 18, 2011</b><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Mariliths will no longer target Shambling Mounds with
              their Cause Serious Wounds ability</li>
            <li>Air Mephits were&nbsp;randomly using their Gust of Wind

          </ul>
          <b>v3.65 – August 7, 2011</b><br />
          <ul>
            <li>The Balor's whip attack was erroneously dealing piercing
              instead of crushing damage</li>
            <li>The Nabassu's Vampiric Touch was causing too little
              damage and didn't properly heal the demon</li>
            <li>Gated fiends can no longer be targeted before the gate
              animation finishes</li>
            <li>Air and Mineral Mephits are now properly immune to the
              effects of the Wand of Cloudkill</li>
            <li>Fiend spell immunities are now applied in a more robust
              manner. Among other things, this rectifies some&nbsp;issues
              with Cambions and Alu-Fiends who previously weren't
              receiving all of their immunities</li>
            <li>Unique fiends (i.e. Tahazzar, Ka'rashur, Aesgareth...)
              will once again yield more XP when killed than their
              generic counterparts i.e. their&nbsp;XP values from the
              unmodded game have been restored</li>
            <li>Pit Fiends can now use their Wish spell to cure
              themselves of blindness and level drain</li>
            <li>Mariliths will now use their Cloudkill ability a bit
              more aggressively. Furthermore, the volume of the IWD
              Marilith soundset was slightly lowered in order to&nbsp;fit in
              with the rest of the BG2 creature sounds</li>
            <li>The durations of all fiend summoning spells have been
              slightly increased</li>
            <li>The Summon Cacofiend scroll was&nbsp;unusable by Illusionists
              if the Spell Revisions mod was installed</li>
            <li>Spell Revisions' version of the Detect Alignment spell
              was&nbsp;not working for non-evil alignments&nbsp;if aTweaks' "Make
              alignment detection spells more accurate" component was
              installed</li>
            <li>Fiends summoned by opponents&nbsp;now properly grant XP when
              killed if both aTweaks and SCSII are installed</li>
            <li>For compatibility reasons, Glabrezu and Balors summoned
              by opponents&nbsp;now use Remove Magic instead of Dispel Magic
              if both aTweaks and SCSII are installed. Furthermore, both
              demons will now try to dispel the party's defenses a bit
              more aggressively</li>
            <li>If SCSII is installed Aesgareth, the Cambion in
              Watcher's Keep, will now retain his original spellbook
              rather than receiving the same spell selection as regular
              Cambions</li>
          </ul>
          <b>v3.64 – August 1, 2011</b><br />
          <ul>
            <li>The mod now installs on Classic Adventures again.</li>
          </ul>
          <b>v3.63 – July 24, 2011</b><br />
          <ul>
            <li>The trapped Cambion in Irenicus' dungeon can no longer
              be harmed before he is released from the magical sphere.
              Furthermore, he should now use his Teleport Without Error
              ability a bit more efficiently</li>
            <li>The strength score of all regular (non-unique) Cambions
              has been lowered to 18/76 (was 19). Furthermore, all
              Cambions can now cast Charm Person at will</li>
            <li>One Ice Troll in the de'Arnise Keep was erroneously
              unaffected by the "Distinctive Creature Coloring"
              component</li>
            <li>The Shield spell and amulet were not protecting the user
              from the fiend/mephit innate version of Magic Missile</li>
            <li>Made some cosmetic adjustments to the way the Scribe
              Scrolls ability is acquired</li>
          </ul>
          <b>v3.62 – July 9, 2011</b><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Maurezhi were erroneously assigned the wrong ability
              scores. They&nbsp;were also wielding a non-enchanted weapon and
              missing some of their advertised PnP traits</li>
            <li>The Cause Fear ability was erroneously using an
              incorrect saving throw penalty</li>
            <li>Balors now properly dual-wield a Vorpal Sword (right
              hand) and a Flaming Whip &nbsp;(left hand)</li>
            <li>Made some changes to the Fiendish Gating component. Most
              notably, Fiends no longer stand idle while opening&nbsp;gates
              and&nbsp;now also give slightly higher priority to gating.
              Furthermore, Fiendish gating can now be disabled at any
              time with a console command:
              CLUAConsole:SetGlobal("RR#FNOGT","GLOBAL",1)</li>
            <li>Hostile Nabassus (except Aec'Letec) will now gate-in
              other Tanar'ri if the Fiendish Gating component is
              installed</li>
            <li>Made some&nbsp;adjustments to the fiend scripts. Most
              notably, fiends of the same type can now call on their
              allies for help during battle&nbsp;if they are off-screen but
              still within shouting range. Also, whenever the party
              rests, the fiends now rest as well</li>
            <li>Added another&nbsp;Wish option to the Pit Fiend's&nbsp;repertoire.
              It is analogous to the player's "Wish: Improved Haste on
              all party members" choice</li>
            <li>The&nbsp;<acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> Fiends
              component now handles the demons inside the Planar Sphere
              a bit differently. Lea'liyl&nbsp;is now treated as a Marilith,
              one of the two generic Tanar'ri becomes a Glabrezu while
              the other remains a Nabassu. Some previously unused
              dialogue lines for Lea'liyl&nbsp;and the Nabassu have also been
              restored</li>
            <li>Added a few load screen hints which explain some of the
              new fiend/mephit abilities in-game</li>
          </ul>
          <b>v3.61 – June 25, 2011</b><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Mephit gating can now be disabled with a console
              command: CLUAConsole:SetGlobal("RR#MNOGT","GLOBAL",1)</li>
            <li>Blinded creatures are now properly protected from the&nbsp;<acronym title="Pen and Paper">PnP</acronym> version of Color

            <li>Gated mephits are now taken into account by the
